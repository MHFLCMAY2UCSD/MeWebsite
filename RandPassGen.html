							To keep my passwords from looking the same and still being able to remember it, I've made myself a Random Password Generator.
							I think this is a great middle man, I had used safari's and chrome but for some reason sometimes it would not prompt me to use those passwords.
							This problem gets really annoying over time and I thought might as well just take matter into my own hand and get rid of the middle man i.e. make my own Password Generator.
