							This software was made in reaction to my friends constant disconnecting/moving me. In the beginning the bot's only purpose was to disconnect more than one member at a time, hence the name "Strikes Twice". Overtime the bot itself took on a new life and dawn on more features such as cleaning up chat rooms and able to enforce ban/kicks
